REQUIREMENTS

Camera: A camera is necessary to capture the video footage that contains the object you want to track.

Object detection algorithm:  An object detection algorithm is used to detect the presence of the object

Object tracking algorithm:  An object tracking algorithm is used to track the object as it moves through the captured footage

Computer hardware: Object tracking requires a significant amount of processing power,

Programming language: Like Python, C++ or MATLAB

Training data: To train your object detection and tracking algorithms, you'll need a large dataset of images or videos containing the object you want to track.

Evaluation metrics: You'll need to define evaluation metrics to measure the performance of your object tracking program. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.)

User interface: Finally, you'll need to create a user interface to interact with your object tracking program.
