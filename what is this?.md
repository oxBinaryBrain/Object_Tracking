How it works!

Object tracking is basically a program built to track the object once its been identified with its identical shape.
The program uses the camera for sensing the shape of the object and saves the identity of that object, so that it can track that particular object by using its identical shape.





## 
Although the building of the program is completed, The deployment requires the camera that should be connected to the PC with the code running to it. 
The the encoded data will recognize the shape of the object to track whenever it appears through the camera content.
