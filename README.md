# Object Tracking using OpenCV and KCF Tracker

This project demonstrates how to perform object tracking using the Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) algorithm provided by the OpenCV library in Python.

## Overview

Object tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time in a video stream. This project utilizes the KCF algorithm, which is a robust and efficient method for tracking objects in video sequences.

## Features

- Real-time object tracking using the webcam feed or any video source.
- User-friendly interface for selecting the Region of Interest (ROI) to be tracked.
- Display of the bounding box around the tracked object in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Webcam or video source

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies (Python and OpenCV).
3. Run the `object_tracking.py` script using Python.
4. Select the object to be tracked by drawing a bounding box around it.
5. Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.

## File Structure
